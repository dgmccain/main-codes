For test_in1.txt, I made a test case for 3 lines of monsters. This
is intended to be the simplest test case, so every line (queue) is
already in ascending order, they each have the same number of
monsters (n=5), the skipover value is only 1, and each queue is left
with only 1 monster after the first phase.

For test_in2.txt, There are now 4 lines (queues) which are not in a pre-determined order, and each line also contains differing sizes of
monsters. The skipover value is 3 for every line and each queue is
still only left with 1 monster after the first phase.

For test_3in.txt, There are now 5 lines (queues) with differing sizes of
monsters. This is also the first test case to use a number of monsters
per line greater than 10. The skipover value is different for each line,
and so is the number of monsters left after the first phase ends.
