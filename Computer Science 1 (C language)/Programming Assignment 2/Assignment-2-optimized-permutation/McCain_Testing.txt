For the provided test cases (contained in "in.txt"), there are 2 tests
for when n=1 and n=3

For my test cases (contained in "in2.txt"), I created 3 more tests
for when n=1, n=5, and n=6

In all tests, I originally included a line - for outputting the current
list of each tree's paired coordinates - within the permutation section
of the code which would run within the base case -> if(index == numTrees).
This process tested the swapping/permutation and recursion of the code.

Additionally, I originally included a line of code within main() which
would just return the result of the distance between 2 trees (containing
4 coordinates) from the getDistance() function, and then output the result
to the console. This process tested the mathematic aspect of the code.

"in3.txt" contains 4 test cases for when n=1, n=5, n=6, and n=8. However,
I could not get n=8 to run as efficiently because of included redundancies.
