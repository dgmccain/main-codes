For "test_in1.txt", I created 2 test cases where the first case reaches the
maximum number of pages (after book 4/6), but the second case does not reach
the maximum number of pages (so all 3 of the books should be read).

For "test_in2.txt", I created 3 test cases that were similar to the previous
test case, but containing more data with higher numbers of pages per book,
proving that a data type of long int was used for the page numbers.

For "test_in3.txt", I created a single test case to prove that in addition
to the data type of long int (used for the number of pages per book), the
data type of long long int was used for the maximum number of pages.

Additionally, I included a display() function within the program to output
(to the console) the number of pages that each book has within each library.
This can be used before and/or after sorting the libraries to check that each
page number is correctly sorted, the maximum number of pages is accurate, and
how many books are contained within each library.
