in1.txt is a small test case, and in2.txt is a larger test case.
in1.txt contains the following data:

7 ingredients
the ingredients' names
3 recipes
	**recipe#1
		*5 ingredients
			ingredient#1 - 10 strawberries
			ingredient#2 - 1 bananas
			ingredient#3 - 3 peanut butter
			ingredient#4 - 2 milk
			ingredient#5 - 1 orange juice
	**recipe#2
		*2 ingredients
			ingredient#1 - 5 strawberries
			ingredient#2 - 1 milk
	**recipe#3
		&3 ingredients
			ingredient#1 - 2 protein
			ingredient#2 - 5 strawberries
			ingredient#3 - 1 milk
2 stores
	store#1
		1 recipe
			10 lbs of recipe#2
	store#2
		2 recipes
			17 lbs of recipe#1
			28 lbs of recipe#3


in2.txt is similar to in1.txt, but instead of 7 ingredients there are 12; instead of 3 recipes there are 4; and instead of 3 stores there are 5.
Increasing the data for in2.txt ensures that the calculations for the code's output are still correct when the input contains differing sizes of ingredients, recipes, and stores.
Just like in1.txt, in2.txt contains data that the main.c code will use to create a double pointer which will store the names of all the ingredients.
Additionally, the code will create a double pointer for a recipe list, which will contain:
	the number of ingredients per recipe, the total quantity of ingredients, and a pointer to the recipe's ingredients.
The pointer to the recipe's ingredients will contain:
	the ingredient id# - which will be used to acces the ingredient name in main(), and the ingredient ratio for the recipe.
Finally, the code will output the number of ingredients to order for each store based upon the quantity (in lbs) of each recipe per store.
