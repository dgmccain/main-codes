*Note before running: vm.c runs from main(), which will need to be renamed (such as vm() for example) before compiling the code.

To run this code:
1) download the vm.c file.
2) -OPTION A-
  run "gcc vm.c input.txt" in terminal.
  run "./a.out input.txt" in terminal.
2) -OPTION B-
  run "gcc -g vm.c input.txt" in terminal.
  run "./a.out input.txt" in terminal.
2) -OPTION A-
  run the program with an IDE and then enter the filename into console.

3) After entering the program into terminal:
enter input as requested by the console (ex. "Enter an Integer: ").

4) Finally, the expected output of the program should be displayed to the console.

*Note: Activation Records are only created when CAL is the opCode, which will output the AR after the stack, separated by the '|' symbol.
