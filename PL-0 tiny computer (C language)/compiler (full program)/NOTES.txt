still need to fix: variables declared within procedure are not currently being
checked if they are accessible. Variable from Main is always accessed instead
of adding a new variable identifier locally. Mark needs to be implemented correctly
instead of pre-assigning all variables to 1 (should initially be 0 at start of block
and be set to 1 at end of block). Lexicographical level is tracked correctly though.
