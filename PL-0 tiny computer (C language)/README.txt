This is a 4 part program to create a PL/0 virtual machine.
The program follows PL/0 instructions, tokenizes input, parses, then compiles.
Details about contents and running each folder are contained within their own README files.

*NOTE: there is currently an error where variables are not properly marked/unmarked.
This leads to issues when variables are accessed within different functions.
Need to fix this to make sure that variables of the same name can exist on different levels*
