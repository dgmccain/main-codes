The following cannot be used, because values need to be explicitly determined...

INSERT INTO employeePosition (employeeID, positionID) VALUES
(SELECT ID FROM employee WHERE firstName='Paris' AND lastName='Lindsey',
SELECT ID FROM position WHERE description='Pilot'),
(SELECT ID FROM employee WHERE firstName='Umaiza' AND lastName='Melia',
SELECT ID FROM position WHERE description='Co-pilot'),
(SELECT ID FROM employee WHERE firstName='Nico' AND lastName='Prince',
SELECT ID FROM position WHERE description='Flight Attendant'),
(SELECT ID FROM employee WHERE firstName='Javan' AND lastName='Rennie',
SELECT ID FROM position WHERE description='Aircraft Mechanic'),
(SELECT ID FROM employee WHERE firstName='Ali' AND lastName='Waters',
SELECT ID FROM position WHERE description='Airport Police'),
(SELECT ID FROM employee WHERE firstName='JohnPaul' AND lastName='Clarke',
SELECT ID FROM position WHERE description='Airline Ticket Agent'),
(SELECT ID FROM employee WHERE firstName='Dane' AND lastName='Kaiser',
SELECT ID FROM position WHERE description='Meteorologist'),
(SELECT ID FROM employee WHERE firstName='Hammad' AND lastName='Newman',
SELECT ID FROM position WHERE description='Baggage Handler'),
(SELECT ID FROM employee WHERE firstName='Maha' AND lastName='Guthrie',
SELECT ID FROM position WHERE description='Baggage Handler'),
(SELECT ID FROM employee WHERE firstName='Tulisa' AND lastName='Roberts',
SELECT ID FROM position WHERE description='Administrative Jobs');

This must be used instead...

INSERT INTO employeePosition (employeeID, positionID) VALUES (1, 1);
INSERT INTO employeePosition (employeeID, positionID) VALUES (2, 2);
INSERT INTO employeePosition (employeeID, positionID) VALUES (3, 3);
INSERT INTO employeePosition (employeeID, positionID) VALUES (4, 6);
INSERT INTO employeePosition (employeeID, positionID) VALUES (5, 7);
INSERT INTO employeePosition (employeeID, positionID) VALUES (6, 11);
INSERT INTO employeePosition (employeeID, positionID) VALUES (7, 14);
INSERT INTO employeePosition (employeeID, positionID) VALUES (8, 15);
INSERT INTO employeePosition (employeeID, positionID) VALUES (9, 15);
INSERT INTO employeePosition (employeeID, positionID) VALUES (10, 16);
